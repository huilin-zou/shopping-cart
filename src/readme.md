# shopping-cart

## Basic idea
A shopping cart is basically a list or array that contains products selected by the user. When the user is finished shopping, they will usually examine the list to double-check that the items, quantities, and prices are correct. If they finds any errors, they should be able to edit the list. Once they are ready, they should be able to check out.
